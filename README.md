# tutorials

I love teaching, especially helping people learn to code. During college, I enjoyed mentoring fellow students, and even after graduating and working full-time as a Software Engineer, I continued tutoring part-time. I’ve volunteered in many settings—local elementary schools, online seminars, and most recently teaching African Malawi refugees HTML and CSS to help them build sustainable careers as web developers. I’ve also worked with American college students to master JavaScript and other core languages. There’s nothing more satisfying than seeing that light bulb go off when someone finally grasps a challenging concept. The links below will take you to my YouTube channel for tutorials, my GitHub repo where I store instructional materials and example code, and my portfolio site at brighamandersen.com if you’d like to see more of my work.
